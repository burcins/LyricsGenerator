'there's too much confusion', i can't get no relief
businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
none of them along the line know what any of it is worth.
'no reason to get excited', the thief he kindly spoke
'there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
but you and i, we've been through that, and this is not our fate
so let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late'.
all along the watchtower, princes kept the view
while all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.
outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
as we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
mark know what followed and what did betide
for it bein' on christmas morninnow, for recreation, we went on a tramp
and we met sergeant napper and corporal vamp
and a little wee drummer intending to camp
for the day bein' pleasant and charming.
'good morning, good morning,' the sergeant he cried
'and the same to you gentleman,' we did reply
intending no harm but means to pass by
for it bein' on christmas morning
'but,' says he, 'my fine fellows, if you will enlist
ten guineas in gold i'll stick in your fist
and a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
and drink the king's health in the morning.
'for a soldier, he leads a very fine life
and he always is blessed with a charming young wife
and he pays all his debts without sorrow or strike
and he always lives pleasant and charminand a soldier he always is decent and clean
in the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
while other poor fellows go dirty and mean
and sup on thin gruel in the morning'.
'but,' says arthur, 'i wouldn't be proud of your clothes
for you've only the lend of them, as i suppose
but you're dare not change them one night, for you know
if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning
and although that we're single and free
we take great delight in our own company
we have no desire strange places to see
althoug that your offers are charming.
'and we have no desire to take your advance
for you'd have no scruples for to send us to france
where we could get shot without warning'oh no,' says the sergeant, 'i'll have no such chat
and neither will i take it from snappy young brats
for if you insult me with one other word
i'll cut off your heads in the morning'.
and arthur and i, we soon drew our hogs
and we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
when a trusty shillelagh came over their head
and bid them take that as fair warning
and their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
we flung them as far as we could in the tide
'now take them up, devils !' cried arthur mcbride
'and temper their edge in the morning!'.
and the little wee drummer, we flattered his bow
and we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
and bade it a tedious returning
and we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks
we paid no respect to their two bloody backs
and we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
and left them for dead in the morning.
and so, to conclude and to finish disputes
we obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
for we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
and bid them look sharp in the morning.
oh, me and my cousin, one artur mcbride
as we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
mark now what followed and what did betide
for it bein' on christmas morning.
to breathe the air around tom paine's
i spied the fairest damsel
that ever did walk in chains
i offer'd her my hand
she took me by the arm
i knew that very instant
she meant to do me harm.
'depart from me this momenti told her with my voice
said she, 'but i don't wish tosaid i, 'but you have no choice'i beg you, sir', she pleaded
from the corners of her mouth
and together we'll fly south'.
just then tom paine, himself
came running from across the field
shouting at this lovely girl
and commanding her to yield
and as she was letting go her grip
up tom paine did run
'i'm sorry, sir', he said to me
'i'm sorry for what she'd done'.
ric is a blues guitarplayer. i met him one day on
the green pastures of the harvard university. -
baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
well i'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just let me follow you down.
can i come home with you, baby can i come home with you ?
yes i'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just let me come home with you.
baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
well i'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just let me follow you down.
yes i'll do anything in this godalmighty world
if you just let me follow you down.
with the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
i courted her proudly, but now she is gone
gone as the season she's taken.
through young summer's breeze, i stole her away
from her mother and sister, though close did they stay
each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
of the two sister, i loved the young
with sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
the constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
by the jealousy of others around her.
for her parasite sister, i had no respect
bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
countless visions of the other she'd reflect
as a crutch for her scenes and her society.
myself, for what i did, i cannot be excused
the changes i was going through can't even be used
for the lies that i told her in hopes not to lose
the could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.
with unseen consciousness, i possessed in my grip
a magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
noticing not that i'd already slipped
to a sin of love's false security.
from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
till the tombstones of damage read me no question but, 'please
what's wrong and what's exactly the matter ?
and so it did happen, like it could have been foreseen
the timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
at the peak of the night, the king and the queen
tumbled all down into pieces.
'the tragic figure' her sister did shout
'leave her alone, god damn you, get outand i in my armor, turning about
and nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
her sister and i in a screaming battleground
and she in between, the victim of sound
soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
all is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
i gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
my mind it was mangled, i ran into the night
leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
the wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
the words to say i'm sorry, i haven't found yet
i think of her often and hope whoever she's met
will be fully aware of how precious she is.
ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
'how good, how good does it feel to be free '?
and i answer them most mysteriously
'are birds free from the chains of the skyway'?
with your pencil in your hand
you see somebody naked
and you say, 'who is that man ?you try so hard
but you don't understand
just what you'll say

you have many contacts
among the lumberjacks
to get you facts
when someone attacks your imagination
but nobody has any respect
anyway they already expect you
to all give a check
to tax-deductible charity organizations.

well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you

he asks you how it feels
and he says, 'here is your throat back
thanks for the loan'.
and you know something is happening

now you see this one-eyed midget
shouting the word 'nowand you say, 'for what reason ?and he says, 'how ?and you say, 'what does this mean ?and he screams back, 'you're a cow
give me some milk
or else go home'.
because something is happening
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones ?
well, you walk into the room
like a camel and then you frown
you put your eyes in your pocket
and your nose on the ground
there ought to be a law
against you comin' around
you should be made
to wear earphones.
does something is happening
and you don't know what it is

a pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
don't it always go to show
you never know what you got till it's gone ?
they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
they took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
don't it always go to show
you never know what you got till it's gone ?

a big yellow buldozer took away the house and land

she wears a necktie and a panama hat
her passport shows another face
from another time and place
she looks nothing like that
and all the remnants of her recent past
are scattered in the wild wind
she walks across the marble floor
where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
she smiles, walks the other way
as the last ship sails and the moon fades away
from black diamond bay.
as the morning light breaks open the greek comes down
and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
'pardon monsieur' the desk clerk says
carefully removes his fez
'am i hearing you right ?and as the yellow fog is lifting
the greek is quickly heading for the second floor
she passes him on the spiral staircase
thinking he's the sovjet ambassador
she starts to speak, but he walks away
as the storm clouds rise and the palm branches away
on black diamond bay.
a soldier sits beneath the fan
doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
lightning strikes, the light blow out
the desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
'can you see anything ?then the greek appears on the second floor
in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
while a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
says 'open up another deckbut the dealer say 'attendez-vous, s'il vous pl itas the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
from black diamond bay.
the desk clerk heard the woman laugh
as he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
he tried to grab the woman's hand
said, 'here's a ring it cost a grandshe said, 'that ain't enoughthen she ran upstairs to pack her bags
she passed the door that the greek had locked
where a handwritten sign read, 'do not disturbshe knocked on it anyway
as the sun went down and the music did play
on black diamond bay.
'i've got to talk to someone quick !but the greek said, 'go away' and he kicked the chair to the floor
he hung there from the chandelier
she cried, 'help there's danger near
please open op the doorthen the volcano erupted
and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
the soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
thinking of forbidden love
but the desk clerk said 'it happens every dayas the stars fell down and the fields burned away
on black diamond bay.
as the island slowly sank
the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
the dealer said 'it's too late now
you can take you money, but i don't know how
you'll spend it in the tombthe tiny man bit the soldier's ear
as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basemen blew
while she's out on the balcony where a stranger tell her
'my darling je vous aime beacoupshe sheds a tear and then begins to pray
as the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
from black diamond bay.
i was siting home alone one night in la
watching old cronkite on the seven o'clock news
it seems there was an earthquake that
left nothing but a panama hat
and a pair of old greek shoes
didn't seem like much was happening
so i turned it off and went to grab another beer
seems like every time you turn around
there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
and there's really nothing anyone can say
and i never did plan to go anyway
to black diamond bay.
a whistlin' loud and merry
made the woods around him ring
and he charmed the heart of a lady
charmed the heart of a lady.
'how old are you, my pretty little miss
how old are you, my honey ?she answered to him with a lovin' smile
'i'll be sixteen come sunday
be sixteen come sunday'.
'come and go with me, my pretty little miss
come and go with me, my honey
take you where the grass grows green
you never will want for money
you never will want for money.
'pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes
all made of spanish leather
get behind me on my horse
and we'll ride off together
we'll both go off together'.
well she pulled off them high-heeled shoes
made of spanish leather
got behind him on his horse
and they rode off together
they both rode off together.
at night the boss came home
inquirring about his lady
the servant spoke before she thought
'she's been with black jack davey
rode off with black jack davey'.
'well, saddle for me my coal-black stud
he's speedier than the gray
i rode all day and i'll ride all night
i'll bring back my lady'.
well, he rode all night till the broad daylight
till he came to a river raginand there he spied his darlin' bride
in the arms of black jack davey
wrapped up with black jack davey.
'pull off, pull off them long blue gloves
all made of the finest leather
give to me your lily-white hand
and we'll go home together
we'll both go home together'.
well, she pulled off them long blue gloves
all made of the finest leather
gave to him her lily-white hand
and said goodbye forever
bid farewell forever.
'would you forsake your house and home
would you forsake your baby ?
would you forsake your husband too
to go with black jack davey
ride off with black jack davey ?'.
'well, i'll forsake my house and home
and i'll forsake my baby
i'll forsake my husband too
for the love of black jack davey
love my black jack davey.
last night i slept in a feather bed
between my husband and baby
tonight i lay on the river banks
in the arms of black jack davey
love my black jack davey'.
before you call him a man?
how many seas must a white dove fly,
before she sleeps in the sand?
and how many times must a cannon ball fly,
before they're forever banned?
the answer my friend is blowing in the wind,
the answer is blowing in the wind.
how many years can a mountain exist,
before it is washed to the sea?
how many years can some people exist,
before they're allowed to be free?
and how many times can a man turn his head,
the answer my friend is blowing in the wind,
the answer is blowing in the wind.
how many times must a man look up,
before he sees the sky?
and how many ears must one man have,
before he can hear people cry ?
and how many deaths will it take till we know,
that too many people have died?
the answer my friend is blowing in the wind,
the answer is blowing in the wind.
the answer my friend is blowing in the wind,
the answer is blowing in the wind.
about a man riding across the desert and starred gregory peck
he was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
the town's people wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
well the marshall now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square
i want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.
well i keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
and you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
you know i can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart
the memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
i can still see the day that you came to me on the pinked desert
in your busted down ford and your platform heels
i could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
ah, but you were right it was perfect as i got in behind the wheel.
well we drove that car all night 'til we got into san antonand we slept near the alamo your skin was so tender and soft
way down in mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
i would have gone on after you but i didn't feel like letting my head get blow off.
well we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the rockies
now i know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul
but i'm too over the edge and i ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times
when i was your only man
and she don't want to remind me. she knows this car would go out of control.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl show me all around the world.
brownsville girl you're my honey love.well we crossed the panthandle and then we headed towards amarillo
we pulled up where henry porter used to live. he owned a wrecking lot outside of
town about a mile
ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. she saw us
come rolling up in a trail of dust
she said 'henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while'.
then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming
a ride back to where she started
but she changed the subject every time money came up
she said 'welcome to the land of the living dead'. you could tell she was
so broken-hearted
she said 'even the swap meets around here are pretty corrupt'.
'how far are you all going ?' ruby asked us with a sigh
'we're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn
until the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin diesruby just smiled and said. 'ah you know some babies never learn'.
something about that movie though well i just can't get it out of my head
but i can't remember why i was in it or what part i was supposed to play
all i remember about it was gregory peck and the way people moved
and a lot of them seemed to be looking my way.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
brownsville girl show me all around the world.
brownsville girl you're my honey love.
well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
i was crossing the street when shots rang out
i didn't know whether to duck or to run so i ran
we got him cornered in the churchyard ? i heard somebody shout.
well you saw my picture in the corpus christi tribune. underneath it it said:
'a man with no alibiyou went out on a limb to testify for me you said i was with you
then when i saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
it was the best acting i saw anybody do.
now i've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trepass but sometimes
you just find yourself over the line
oh if there's an original thought out there i could use it right now
you now i feel pretty good but that ain't saying much i could feel a whole lot better
if you were just here by my side to show me how.
well i'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring gregory peck
yeh but you know it's not the one i had in mind
he's got a new one out now i don't even know what it's about
but i'll se him in anything so i'll stand in line.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl show me all around the world
brownsville girl you're my honey love.
you know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned
the only things we knew for sure about henry porter is that his name
wasn't henry porter
and you know there was something about you baby that i liked that was always too
good for this world
just like you always said there was something about me you liked that i left behind
in the french quarter.
strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who
are most content
i don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when i'm gone
you always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most
convenient then they repent
and i always said. 'hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on'.
there was a movie i seen one time i think i sat through it twice
i don't remember who i was or where i was bound
all i remember about it was it starred gregory peck he wore a gun and he was shot
in the back
seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls
teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl show me all around the world
brownsville girl you're my honey love.

everything about you is bringing me
misery.
little red wagon
little red bike
i ain't no monkey but i know what i like
i like the way you love me strong and slow
i'm taking you with me honey baby
when i go.
life is sad
life is a bust
all ya can do is do what you must
you do what you must do and ya do it well
i'll do it for you honey baby
can't you tell ?
she's all in her tender years
she fell in love with a sailor boy
it's true she loved him well
for to go off to sea with him
like she did not now how
she longed to see that seaport town
of canadee-i-o.
so he bargained with the sailor boy
all for a piece of gold
straightaway then he led her
down into the hold
sayin', 'i'll dress you up in sailor's clothes
your jacket shall be blue
you'll see that seaport town
of canadee-i-o'.
now, when the other sailors heard the news
well, they fell into a rage
and with all the ship's company
they were willing to engage
sayin', 'we'll tie her hands and feet, my boys
overboard we'll throw her
she'll never see that seaport town
called canadee-i-o'.
well, he too fell in rage
and with the whole ships' company
he was willing to engage
sayin', 'she'll stay all in sailor's clothes
her color shall be blue
she'll see that seaport town
called canadee-i-o'.
now, when they come down to canada
scarcely 'bout half a year
she's married this bold captain
who called her his dear
she's dressed in silks and satins now
she cuts a gallant show
finest of the ladies
down canadee-i-o.
come all you fair and tender girls
wheresoever you may bee
i'd have you to follow your own true love
whene'er he goes to sea
for the sailors prove false to you
well, the captain he might prove true
you'll see the honor i have gained
by the wearing of the blue.
we ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
an' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
in the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
with faces hidden as the walls were tightening
as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
dissolved into the bells of the lightning
tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked
tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
an' the poet an the painter far behind his rightful time
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
for the disrobed faceless forms of no position
tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
all down in taken-for granted situations
tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
for the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
even though a clouds's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
an' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
for the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
an' for each unharmfull, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
starry-eyed an' laughing as i recall when we were caught
trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
as we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
for the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
an' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

a cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer
some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere
but i can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
whom nature's beast fears as they come and all i see are dark eyes.
they tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
they tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, i'm sure it is
but i feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized
all i feel is heat and flame, and all i see are dark eyes.
oh, the french girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling gods of speed and steel
oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes.
please don't put a price on my soul
my burden is heavy
my dreams are beyond control
when that steamboat whistle blows
i'm gonna give you all i got to give
and i do hope you receive it well
depending on the way you feel that you live.
dear landlord
please heed these words that i speak
i know you've suffered much
but in this you are not so unique
all of us, at times we might work too hard
and anyone can fill his life up
with things he can see but he just cannot touch.
dear landlord
please don't dismiss my case
i'm not about to argue
i'm not about to move to no other place
now, each of us has his own special gift
and you know this was meant to be true
and if you don't underestimate me
i won't underestimate you.
and you haven't got a friend
just remember that death is not the end
and all that you held sacred
falls down and dows not bend
just remember that death is not the end.
not the end, not the end
just remember that death is not the end.
when you're standing on the cross-roads
that you cannot comprehend
just remember that death is not the end
and all your dreams have vanished
and you don't know what's up the bend
just remember that death is not the end.
not the end, not the end
just remember that death is not the end.
when the storm clouds gather round you
and heavy rains descend
and there's nowhere there to comfort you
with helping hand to lend
just remember that death is not the end.
not the end, not the end
just remember that death is not the end.
oh the tree of life is growing
where the spirit never dies
and the bright light of salvation
shines in dark and empty skies
when the cities are on fire
when the burning flesh of men
just remember that death is not the end
and you search in vain to find
just one law abiding citizen
just remember that death is not the end.
not the end, not the end
just remember that death is not the end.
they're painting the passports brown
the beauty parlor is filled with sailors
the circus is in town
here comes the blind commissioner
they've got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
the other is in his pants
and the riot squad they're restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row.
cinderella, she seems so easy
'it takes one to know one,' she smiles
and puts her hands in her back pockets
bette davis style
and in comes romeo, he's moaning
'you belong to me i believeand someone says, 'you're in the wrong place, my friend
you better leaveand the only sound that's left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweeping up
on desolation row.
now the moon is almost hidden
the stars are beginning to hide
the fortunetelling lady
has even taken all her things inside
all except for cain and abel
and the hunchback of notre dame
everybody is making love
or else expecting rain
and the good samaritan, he's dressing
he's getting ready for the show
he's going to the carnival tonight
on desolation row.
now ophelia, she's 'neath the window
for her i feel so afraid
on her twenty-second birthday
she already is an old maid
to her, death is quite romantic
she wears an iron vest
her profession's her religion
her sin is her lifelessness
and though her eyes are fixed upon
noah's great rainbow
she spends her time peeking
into desolation row.
einstein, disguised as robin hood
with his memories in a trunk
passed this way an hour ago
with his friend, a jealous monk
he looked so immaculately frightful
as he bummed a cigarette
then he went off sniffing drainpipes
and reciting the alphabet
you would not think to look at him
but he was famous long ago
for playing the electric violin
on desolation row.
dr. filth, he keeps his world
inside of a leather cup
but all his sexless patients
they're trying to blow it up
now his nurse, some local loser
she's in charge of the cyanide hole
and she also keeps the cards that read
'have mercy on his soulthey all play on penny whistles
you can hear them blow
if you lean your head out far enough
from desolation row.
across the street they've nailed the curtains
they're getting ready for the feast
the phantom of the opera
in a perfect image of a priest
they're spoonfeeding casanova
to get him to feel more assured
then they'll kill him with self-confidence
after poisoning him with words
and the phantom's shouting to skinny girls
'get outa here if you don't knowcasanova is just being punished for going
to desolation row.
at midnight all the agents
and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
then they bring them to the factory
where the heart-attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene
is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that nobody is escaping
to desolation row.
they be to nero's neptune
the titanic sails at dawn
everybody's shouting
'which side are you on ?and ezra pound and t. s. eliot
fighting in the captain's tower
while calypso singers laugh at them
and fishermen hold flowers
between the windows of the sea
where lovely mermaids flow
and nobody has to think too much
about desolation row.
yes, i received your letter yesterday
about the time the door knob broke
when you asked me how i was doing
was that some kind of joke ?
all these people that you mention
yes, i know them, they're quite lame
i had to rearrange their faces
and give them all another name
right now i can't read too good
dont send me no more letters no
not unless you mail them
from desolation row.
most anywhere you go
and his holdings are in texas
and his name is diamond joe.
and he carries all his money
in a diamond-studded jar
he never took much trouble
with the process of the law.
i hired out to diamond joe, boys
did offer him my hand
he gave a string of horses
so old they could not stand.
and i nearly starved to death, boys
he did mistreat me so
and i never saved a dollar
in the pay of diamond joe.
and his meat you couldn't chaw
nearly drove me crazy
with the waggin'of his jaw.
and the tellin' of his story
mean to let you know
that there never was a rounder
that could lie like diamond joe.
now, i tried three times to quit him
but he did argue so
i'm still punchin' cattle
in the pay of diamond joe.
and when i'm called up yonder
and it's my time to go
give my blankets to my buddies
give the fleas to diamond joe.
i spied my true love comin' my way
down along the cove
i spied my true love comin' my way
i say, 'lord, have mercy, mama
it sure is good to see you comin' today'.
down along the cove
i spied my little bundle of joy
down along the cove
i spied my little bundle of joy
i'm so glad you're my boy'.
down along the cove
we walked together hand in hand
down along the cove
we walked together hand in hand
ev'rybody watchin' us go by
knows we're in love, yes, and they understand.
or who you thought you were talking to
i figure maybe we're even
or maybe i'm one up on you
i send you all my money
just like i did before
i tried to reach you honey
but you're driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore.
i ain't gotta get lost in this current
i don't like playing cat and mouse
no gentleman likes making love to a servant
especially when he's in his fathers house
i never could guess your weight baby
never needed to call you my whore
i always thought you were straight baby
but you're driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore.
the bottom of the barrel is too
i waited years sometimes for what i wanted
everybody can't be as lucky as you
never no more do i wonder
why you don't never play with me any more
at any moment you could go under
cause you're driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore.
you and me we had completeness
i give you all of what i could provide
we weren't on the wrong side sweetness
we were the wrong side
i've already ripped out the phones honey
you can't walk the streets in a war
i can't finish this alone honey
you're driftin' too far from shore
you're driftin' too far from shore.
come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one
i could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed door
but i will always be emotionally yours.
come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart
come baby, teach me, come baby reach me, let the music start
i could be dreaming but i keep believing you're the one i'm living for
and i will always be emotionally yours.
it's like my whole life never happened
when i see you, it's if i never had a thought
i know this dream, it might be crazy
but it's the only one i've got. okay.
come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, i would be satisfied
come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide
i could be unraveling wherever i'm traveling, even to foreign shores
but i will always be emotionally yours.
i believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
feeling funny in my mind, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die
well, i don't mind dying
but i hate to leave my children crying
well, i look over yonder to that burying ground
look over yonder to that burying ground
sure seems lonesome, lord, when the sun goes down
feeling funny in my eyes, lord,
i believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
feeling funny in my eyes, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die
i hate to leave my children crying
there's a black smoke rising, lord
it's rising up above my head, up above my head
it's rising up above my head, up above my head
and tell jesus make up my dying bed.
i'm walking kind of funny, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
yes i'm walking kind of funny, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die
fixing to die, fixing to die
well, i don't mind dying
but i hate to leave my children crying.

its curfew gull just glides
upon four-legged forest clouds
the cowboy angel rides
with his candle lit into the sun
though its glow is waxed in black
all except when 'neath the trees of eden.
the lamppost stands with folded arms
its iron claws attached
to curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
though it shadows metal badge
all and all can only fall
with a crashing but meaningless blow
no sound ever comes from the gates of eden.
the savage soldiers sticks his head in sand
and then complains
unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
but still remains
upon the beach where hound dogs bay
at ships with tatooed sails
heading for the gates of eden.
with a time-rusted compass blade
alladin and his lamp
sits with utopian hermit monks
side saddle on the golden calf
and on their promises of paradise
you will not hear a laugh
all except inside the gates of eden.
relationships of ownership
they whisper in the wings
to those condemned to act accordingly
and wait for succeeding kings
the lonesome sparrow sings
there are no kings inside the gates of eden.
the motorcycle black madonna
two-wheeled gypsy queen
and her silver-studded phantom cause
the gray flannel dwarf to scream
as he weeps to wicked birds of prey
who pick up on his bread crumb sins
and there are no sins inside the gates of eden.
the kingdoms of experience
in the precious wind they rot
while paupers change possessions
each one wishing for what the other has got
and the princess and the prince
discuss what's real and what is not
it doesn't matter inside the gates of eden.
the foreign sun, it squints upon
a bed that is never mine
as friends and other strangers
from their fates try to resign
leaving men wholly totally free
to do anything they wish to do but die
and there are no trials inside the gates of eden.
at dawn my lower comes to me
and tells me of her dreams
with no attempts to shovel the glimpse
into the ditch of what each one means
at times i think there are no words
but these to tell what's true
and there are no truths outside the gates of eden.
every link was jesus name
keep your hand on that plow, hold on
oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.

oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.v

oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.
oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.

you got the crazy rhythm when you walk
you make me nervous when you start to talk
i had a dream about you, baby
a dream about you, baby
late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
standin' on the highway, you flag me down
said, take me, daddy, to the nearest town
i had a dream about you, baby
had a dream about you, baby
late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
my limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin
you kiss me, baby, in the coffee stop
you made me so bad, you gotta stop
i had a dream about you, baby

late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
the join is jumpin' it's really somethinthe beat is pumpin, my heart is thumpinspent my money on you honey
my limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin
you had a white rag wrapped around your head
wearing a long dress fire engine red
i had a dream about you, baby

late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
while we all sup sorrow with the poor
there's a song that will linger forever in our ears
oh, hard times, come again no more.
'tis the song, the sign of the weary
hard times, hard times, come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
oh hard times, come again no more.
while we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
there are frail forms fainting at the door
though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
oh, hard times, come again no more.
'tis the song, the sign of the weary
hard times, hard times, come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
there's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
with a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
oh, hard times, come again no more.
'tis the song, the sign of the weary
hard times, hard times, come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
oh hard times, come again no more.
'tis the song, the sign of the weary
hard times, hard times, come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
oh hard times, come again no more.
highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
if i don't get the girl i'm loving
won't go down to highway 51 no more.
well, i know that highway like i know my hand
yes, i know that highway like i know the back of my hand
running from up wisconsin way down to no man's land.
well, if i should die before my time should come
and if i should die before my time should come
won't you bury my body out on the highway 51.
highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
i said, highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
if i don't get the girl i'm loving
won't go down to highway 51 no more.
and it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me, oh god, i'm one.
my mother was a tailor, she sowed these new blue jeans
my sweetheart was a gambler, lord, down in new orleans.
now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
and the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
he fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
and the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town
.
but shun that house in new orleans they call the rising sun.
well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
i'm going back to new orleans to wear that ball and chain.
i'm going back to new orleans, my race is almost run
i'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun.
there is a house in new orleans they call the rising sun
and it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me, oh god, i'm one.
enter patty valentine from the upper hall.
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
cries out, my god, they killed them all!
here comes the story of the hurricane,
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin' that he never done.
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world.
three bodies lyin' there does patty see
and another man named bello, movin' around mysteriously.
i didn't do it, he says, and he throws up his hands
i was only robbin' the register, i hope you understand.
i saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
one of us had better call up the cops.
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashinin the hot new jersey night.
meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that.
in paterson that's just the way things go.
if you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'less you wanna draw the heat.
alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops.
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowlin' around
he said, i saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.
and miss patty valentine just nodded her head.
cop said, wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men.
four in the mornin' and they haul rubin in,
take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.
the wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
says, wha'd you bring him in here for? he ain't the guy!
yes, here's the story of the hurricane,
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin' that he never done.
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world.
four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
rubin's in south america, fightin' for his name
while arthur dexter bradley's still in the robbery game
and the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
remember that murder that happened in a bar?
you think you'd like to play ball with the law?
think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?
don't forget that you are white.
arthur dexter bradley said, i'm really not sure.
cops said, a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend bello
now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
you'll be doin' society a favor.
that sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder on him
he ain't no gentleman jim.
rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much.
it's my work, he'd say, and i do it for pay
and when it's over i'd just as soon go on my way
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail.
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
all of rubin's cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
the judge made rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
and though they could not produce the gun,
the d.a. said he was the one who did the deed
and the all-white jury agreed.
rubin carter was falsely tried.
the crime was murder one, guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool's hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
where justice is a game.
now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha in a ten-foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell.
that's the story of the hurricane,
but it won't be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he's done.
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world.
without family or friends
where another man's life might begin
that's exactly where mine ends
i have tried my hand at bribery
blackmail and deceit
and i've served time for ev'rything
'cept begging on the street.
well, once i was rather prosperous
there was nothing i did lack
i had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
and silk upon my back
but i did not trust my brother
which led me to my fatal doom
to wander off in shame.
kind ladies and kind gentlemen
soon i will be gone
but let me just warn you all
before i do pass on:
stay free from petty jealousies
live by no man's code
and hold your judgement for yourself
lest you wind up on his road.
look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
in another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
to some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
i and i
in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
think i'll go out and go for a walk
not much happening here, nothing ever does
besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk
i got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
i and i
in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race
it goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face
and to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
outside of two men on a train platform there's nobody in sight
they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
the world could come to an end tonight, but that's all right
she could still be there sleeping when i get back.
i and i
in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
noontime, and i'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part
into the narrow lanes, i can't stumble or stay put
someone else is speaking with my mouth, but i'm listening only to my heart
i've made shoes for everyone, even you, while i still go barefoot.
i and i
in creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
alive as you or me
tearing through these quarters
in the utmost misery
with a blanket underneath his arm
and a coat of solid gold
searching for the very souls
whom already have been sold.
'arise, arise', he cried so loud
with a voice without restraint
'come out ye gifted kings and queens
and hear my sad complaint
no martyr is among ye now
so go on your way accordingly
but know you're not alone'.
i dreamed i saw st. augustine
alive with fiery breath
and i dreamed i was amongst the ones
that put him out to death
oh, i awoke in anger
so alone and terrified
i put my fingers against the glass
and bowed my head and cried.
who wishes he would've stayed home
who uses all his power to do evil
but in the end is always left so alone
that man whom with his fingers cheats
and who lies with ev'ry breath
who passionately hates his life
and likewise fears his death.
i pity the poor immigrant
whose strength is spent in vain
whose heaven is like ironsides
whose tears are like rain
who eats but is not satisfied
who falls in love with wealth itself
and turns his back on me.
i pity the poor immigrant
who tramples through the mud
who fills his mouth with laughing
and who builds his town with blood
whose visions in the final end
must shatter like the glass
i pity the poor immigrant
when his gladness comes to pass.
i'm just like him, the same as you
i'm everybody's brother and son
i ain't different than anyone
it ain't no use a-talking to me
it's just the same as talking to you.
i was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
i figured i was ready for cassius clay
i said 'fee, fie, fo, fum, cassius clay here i come
26, 27, 28, 29, i'm gonna make your face look just like mine
five, four, three, two, one, cassius clay you'd better run
99, 100 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleenf.
well, i don't know, but i've been told
the streets in heaven are lined with gold<
i ask you how things could get much worse
if the russians happen to get up there first
wowee! pretty scary !
now, i'm liberal, but to a degree
i want ev'rybody to be free
but if you think that i'll let barry goldwater
move in next door and mary my daughter
you must think i'm crazy !
i wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in cuba.
well, i set my monkey on the log
and ordered him to do the dog
he wagged his tail and shook his head
and he went and did the cat instead
he's a weird monkey, very funky.
i sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
i had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
and my wig-hat falling in my face
but they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
i gotta woman, she's so mean
she sticks my boots in the washing machine
sticks me with buckshot when i'm nude
puts bubblegum in my food
she's funny, wants my money, calls me honey.
now i gotta friend who spends his life
stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife
dreams of strangling me with a scarf
when my name comes up he pretends to barf
i've got a million friends !
now they asked me to read a poem
at the sorority sister's home
i got knocked down and my head was swimmini wound up with the dean of women
yippee ! i'm a poet, and i know it
hope i don't blow it.
i'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
so i look like a walking mountain range
and i'm gonna ride into omaha on a horse
out to the country club and the golf course
carry the new york times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
you're probably wondering by now
just what this song is all about
what's probably got you baffled more
what this thing here is for
it's nothing
it's something i learned over in england
